# Wine Reviews Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning
This repository contains the code and datasets for analyzing wine reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to explore and classify wine reviews by leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, sentiment analysis, and machine learning models.

# Problem Statement
Major Wine Producers: Identify the major wine-producing countries and determine which types of wine receive the highest ratings in these countries.
Best Rated Wines by Price: Explore the best-rated wines across different price categories.
Common Descriptions: Analyze the most common descriptions for the highest-rated wines produced in different countries.
# Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the code.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
NLTK: For natural language processing tasks.
# Project Structure
The code folder contains the following two scripts:

Wine Review Analysis with Detailed Explanation (wine_review_analysis.py)
This script includes detailed coding and explanations, addressing the problem statements above. It guides you through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and visualizations to uncover insights about wine reviews.

Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning (wine_quality_prediction.py)
This script focuses on predicting the quality of wine using a machine learning model. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to classify wine quality based on various features.
